## Using Chocobot

Chocobot is designed to provide strategy information for duties (Dungeons, Trials, Raids and Ultimate Raids), as well as individual bosses. As such, there are two commands designed to help look up this information:

- The !duty command presents strategy information for an entire duty, including all bosses within that duty.
- The !boss command presents strategy information solely for a single boss.

### !duty Command

To search for duty strategy information, use the following command:

> !duty <search>

- **search** : The search term to use for locating the corresponding duty. This can be an exact name match, a partial match, or even abbreviations, e.g:

```
!duty Sastasha
!duty matoya
!duty totorak hard
!duty e9s
```

### !boss Command
